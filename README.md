# Titanic-Survival-Predictor
Background of the project:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this problem, it was asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

About project:
Performed exploratory and statistical analysis on Titanic datasets, and predicted 79 â€“ 84%  survival chances of passengers and crew on the ship using One Hot Encoding based on categories: gender, class, fares, age using scikit Machine Learning to do Logistics Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree for training and validating data splitting and visualized the confusion matrix.
